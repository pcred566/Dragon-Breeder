Game has time system that lasts unspecifically but cyclically, maybe 10 days?

REMEMBER THIS:
	No color swapping required! Load the image, use a 'multiply' overlay to
	change base color, then all that is required is an image pattern to create
	other visual textures like stripes and spots that can be overlayed onto the
	original image after they have been overlaid with the proper color.
